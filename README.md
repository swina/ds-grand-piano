## The Story
Grand Piano is a simple instrument which is focused on the sound quality. 
It's quite light due to the good samples quality with a very low load of the CPU
Based on high quality samples and working hardly on the correct mapping the goal was to create a simple Grand Piano with a good sound.
Grand Piano samples are quite difficult to manipulate, to set the correct loop points (cross-zero): this was the most difficult part.
Working hard prevents to set round-robin environment always difficult to arrange and set correctly.
Key ranges are from A-1 to C7. Added also Reverb control in order to simulate different ambience depending on your needs.

## Using the instrument

- default value 850 for a clear
